# Sentimental Analysis for Shanghai Exchange #

## Stage 1: Social media statistics of Chinese trader communities ##

As first stage, we plan to calculate some trending statistics of
several popular Chinese trader communities. There are two basic
tasks:

1. Scraping threads from popular trader communities

2. Calculating statistics from scrapped threads

- Statistics for individual stock: (mean, std, median etc.) of
  threads/(hour, day, month);

- Cross sector comparison & ranking: compare sentiment trending among
  multi sectors.

- Cross-markets comparison & ranking: compare Chinese markets with
  other global main markets. e.g. ASX, SGX, NYSE, LSE.
